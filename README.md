# Codsoft - Machine Learning Internship Projects
Welcome to the **Codsoft** repository, where I present the Machine Learning projects I developed during my internship with CodSoft from October 5 to November 5, 2024. Each project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to real-world tasks, such as **text classification, fraud detection, and customer behavior analysis**.

## Project 1: Movie Genre Classification
In this project, I built a model to predict a movie's genre based on its plot summary. Techniques such as **TF-IDF** and **word embeddings** were applied to transform text data, and various classifiers, including **Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines**, were experimented with to determine the most accurate approach.

## Project 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a dataset with transaction details, I developed a model that applies algorithms like **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests** to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent. Emphasis was placed on achieving a balance between precision and recall.

## Project 3: Customer Churn Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn in a subscription-based service. By analyzing customer demographics and behavior, I applied algorithms such as **Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting** to build a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning.

## Project 4: Spam SMS Detection
In this project, I created a model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. I used text preprocessing methods, such as **TF-IDF and word embeddings**, and classifiers like **Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines** to develop an effective spam filter.

_This repository demonstrates hands-on implementations of machine learning principles, covering data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation. Each project includes a Jupyter Notebook detailing the data pipeline, exploratory analysis, model selection, and evaluation metrics, making this a valuable reference for both learning and application in machine learning._
